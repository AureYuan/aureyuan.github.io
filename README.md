### About Jekyll
Github recommend user to use jekyll as their web design tool and github use it to generate our website **by default**. <br>
However, jekyll does not support Windows yet, and I do not want to install environment in order to use jekyll.<br>
So I decided to config jekyll myself and try to find a way let github render my website as I want.
