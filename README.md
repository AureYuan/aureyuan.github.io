# Welcome !
Welcome to my blogs' repository.   
I will write down the develop process here.

### About Jekyll
Github recommend user to use jekyll as their web design tool and github use it to generate our website ***by default***. <br>
However, jekyll does not support Windows yet, and I do not want to install environment in order to use jekyll.<br>
So I decided to config jekyll myself and try to find a way let github render my website as I want.

### Ways to create my blogs
Since Github use jekyll by default, so the only downside of not install jekyll into local is you cannot test it locally and immediately. <br>
Therefore, I am going to try all files manually. My ***final goal*** is to achieve whatever the website I want.
